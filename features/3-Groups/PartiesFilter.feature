Feature: Parties filter

The events filter allows admins and hosts to be able to filter
down the list of events that they have access to.

This helps to find for example events related to a specific group
for a particular date range.

This is particularly useful for accessing the various stats 
for a group of events.

The list can be filtered by group, individual parties, and a date range.

The filter can be reset.

In the filtered results, we see:

- headline stats
- the list of parties
- impact tab with volunteer stats, fix stats, most repaired devices, and CO2 equivalence stats
- details tab with devices restarted stats, category details stats, devices restarted per category stats

We can also download the filtered results as a list.
