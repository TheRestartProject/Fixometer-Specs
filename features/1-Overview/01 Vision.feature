Feature: 01 Vision

The Fixometer allows us to capture device repairs and to report
on the impact of those repairs.

Initially developed for Restart Parties, we are looking to expand
its usage further to other repair and reuse organisations.

The flourishing of community repair initiatives across Europe shows
there is strong demand for repair of small electrical and electronic devices,
often unmet by the commercial sector. However, scaling up waste prevention and 
resource efficiency requires the rebirth of a vibrant commercial repair sector. 
In order to get there, we need new regulations reducing barriers to repair and 
targeted pressure on manufacturers to produce more repairable devices. We need 
much more data and evidence to help regulators take the right decisions, and to 
inform manufacturers and retailers of consumers’ frustration with the status quo. 
This comes at a timely moment, when the European Union is increasing its focus 
on resource efficiency and eco-design, but still lacks real data about consumers’ 
perceptions and experience of these issues. 

In 2015 The Restart Project developed the first iteration of the “Fixometer”, a 
web application monitoring the growing impact of the activities it carries directly 
and through its international network of partners. The tool allows community 
repair organisers in 9 countries to log all performed repairs, capturing the 
environmental and social impact of their work: the weight of waste prevented, the 
CO2 prevented by displacing unnecessary purchases and the hours volunteered. 
The application has detailed environmental profiles for 35 types of products normally 
serviced at Restart events. The data collected through the tool is however much 
richer: it includes information about the types of faults and the most recurrent 
ones, the success rate of repairs performed per each product category, the requirement 
for spare parts, and most importantly information on specific brands and models. 

The vision: an open data repository of the repair economy
The Restart Project has so far collected data on just over 1,700 repairs. We will 
explore creating an open data standard for post-warranty repairs together with other 
community repair networks like Repair Cafes (a network of 1,000 community repair
groups across the world), and potentially repair SMEs, aggregating data on what is 
breaking and barriers to repair, and influence decision-makers and regulators in Brussels. 
When collected at much greater scale, this type of information has the potential to 
become extremely valuable to manufacturers and retailers, as well as regulators and 
consumers’ associations. Our work will generate a publicly accessible database on the 
post-warranty repair economy, providing unique insights and trends on recurrent faults, 
missed opportunities for the repair sector, barriers to repair and data about the 
reliability of specific brands and models.

Business model
We’re planning to adopt a freemium model to support this work. Most collected data will be released as open data, directly available for download by anyone. The real value is in data linking faults and repairability rates with specific brands and products. This data will be owned by The Restart Project and sold to clients with a direct interest in the sector. We will also develop market intelligence services with a focus on sectorial or company-specific data, available as one-off snapshots or as subscriptions with regular updates and trends.

The support we need
In order to move to a viable product, the Restart Project needs support in research and development, in these key areas:
Researching needs and testing demand from stakeholders/clients
Researching additional clients and partners for the initiative
Further developing the online platform  
Developing and testing the model for involvement of commercial repairers
Researching funding opportunities to scale the project across Europe

Case scenarios for main target users

Regulators and policy-makers will access a unique barometer of citizen frustration and demand for action: improvements on design, spare part provision, repair services and prolonged support. By comparing actual failure rates of specific products and brands, policy-makers will have independent data to back their efforts during investigations, research and negotiations. Examples could include the need to review regulations on availability of quality or genuine spare parts; new approaches to authorising distribution of products in the EU based on repairability, faults, service provision.


Manufacturers will be able to access data about their products normally not available to them. While most in-warranty repairs are performed by a manufacturer's authorised repair network or directly in-house, post-warranty repairs are not, and data about them is much harder to gather. Consumers often rely on third-party repairers or give up on brands entirely, at times ignoring their consumer rights.  The type of information we collect can be instrumental for prioritising changes in their future products or services. Access to most frustrating recurrent faults that consumers are willing to repair will provide them with insights into what might lead a consumer to switch brand or confirm loyalty.


Repair SMEs will seamlessly log data about their activities, receiving in exchange an environmental report of the impact of their work. Restart will work exclusively with commercial repairers providing adequate information on the standards of their work, such as: provision of warranty and provenance of parts. Through their involvement they will become more visible to the public and might access additional opportunities via manufacturers, spare parts providers and others.


Other potential clients could be insurance companies; consumers' associations; retailers; academic institutions.
