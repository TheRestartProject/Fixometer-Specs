Feature: 02 Goals

* Increase level of data capture.
* Scaling up waste prevention and resource efficiency requires the rebirth of a 
vibrant commercial repair sector. 
* Produce much more data and evidence to help regulators take the right decisions
* To inform manufacturers and retailers of consumers' frustration with the status quo
* Creating an open data standard for post-warranty repairs together with other 
community repair networks like Repair Cafes (a network of 1,000 community repair
groups across the world), and potentially repair SMEs, aggregating data on what is 
breaking and barriers to repair, and influence decision-makers and regulators in Brussels. 

Capabilities
The tool allows community 
repair organisers in 9 countries to log all performed repairs, capturing the 
environmental and social impact of their work: the weight of waste prevented, the 
CO2 prevented by displacing unnecessary purchases and the hours volunteered. 
The application has detailed environmental profiles for 35 types of products normally 
serviced at Restart events. The data collected through the tool is however much 
richer: it includes information about the types of faults and the most recurrent 
ones, the success rate of repairs performed per each product category, the requirement 
for spare parts, and most importantly information on specific brands and models. 

When collected at much greater scale, this type of information has the potential to 
become extremely valuable to manufacturers and retailers, as well as regulators and 
consumersâ€™ associations. 

* generate a publicly accessible database on the 
post-warranty repair economy
* provide unique insights and trends on recurrent faults, 
missed opportunities for the repair sector, barriers to repair and data about the 
reliability of specific brands and models.

* produce data linking faults and repairability rates with specific brands and products

* develop market intelligence services with a focus on sectorial or company-specific data
* available as one-off snapshots or as subscriptions with regular updates and trends

* Regulators and policy-makers will access a unique barometer of citizen frustration and 
demand for action: improvements on design, spare part provision, repair services and prolonged support. 
* By comparing actual failure rates of specific products and brands, policy-makers will have 
independent data to back their efforts during investigations, research and negotiations. 
* Examples could include the need to review regulations on availability of quality or genuine 
spare parts; new approaches to authorising distribution of products in the EU based on repairability, faults, service provision.


* Manufacturers will be able to access data about their products normally not available to them. 
* While most in-warranty repairs are performed by a manufacturer's authorised repair network or 
directly in-house, post-warranty repairs are not, and data about them is much harder to gather. 
* Consumers often rely on third-party repairers or give up on brands entirely, at times ignoring their consumer rights.  
* The type of information we collect can be instrumental for prioritising changes in their future products or 
services. 
* Access to most frustrating recurrent faults that consumers are willing to repair will provide them 
with insights into what might lead a consumer to switch brand or confirm loyalty.

* Repair SMEs will seamlessly log data about their activities, receiving in exchange an 
environmental report of the impact of their work. 
* Restart will work exclusively with commercial repairers providing adequate information 
on the standards of their work, such as: provision of warranty and provenance of parts. 
* Through their involvement they will become more visible to the public and might access 
additional opportunities via manufacturers, spare parts providers and others.

Other potential clients could be insurance companies; consumers' associations; retailers; academic institutions.
