Feature: Add venue details

Users can add the name and address of the venue where the party
is taking place.

The venue location is geocoded and pin-pointed on a map in order
to display to visitors to the front-facing website later on.

Notes: we used to only have one field, named 'Location', into which the
user would input the address, geocode, and then had to go back and
update the field to a more publicly dislpayable name (the venue name, essentially.)
Users found this confusing so we split it out into two fields.  
Venue Name is the field that displays on therestartproject.org homepage
and related events pages.
