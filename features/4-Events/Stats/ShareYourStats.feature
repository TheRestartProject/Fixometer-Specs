@stats
Feature: Share party statistics

Ability for groups/hosts to embed widgets that highlight the achievements
of individual parties in their websites.

The host is presented with a basic piece of HTML which will pull in 
statistics for the party when it is embedded into a website.

The two statistics available for embedding are:

- headline party stats (date, location, participants, restarters, CO2/waste, fixed, repairable, repaired)
- CO2 equivalence visualisation

As the embed may be embedded in various places at various, it needs to be responsive.
