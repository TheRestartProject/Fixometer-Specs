Feature: Hours volunteered

We provide stats on the hours volunteered at events.

If there is no figure recorded for the number of volunteers at
the party, then we assume 12 hours volunteered total by Restarters as a default.
If we do have recorded how many volunteers at the party, then we add 3 hours for
each volunteer.

In addition to this, we add 9 hours on for the overall time volunteered by
the party host.

TODO: should we calculate the hours volunteered based on the length of the
party?  At present, Restart parties are always 3 hours long, but we may need
to be more flexible witht this.
